# Manny Toolbox

Quick Start: https://mannylee.github.io/manny-toolbox/

This toolbox contains a collection of miscellaneous web utilities that are not complete enough to be its own standalone tool, but contains features that can still be useful for very specific tasks.

## Tools

### [List Magic](https://mannylee.github.io/manny-toolbox/?page=listmagic)
Converts a line of text (based on a delimiter character) into a list of individual text items, and back.
